# Description of the assignment

The user interface I made is based and inspired on the original DOOM series video games from the early 1990s. The interface opens, and has several animated objects appearing on screen. The overall colour palette is red, as the same as the old games. The UI, along with the animations and drawings, will display a slideshow of the images of the enemies encountered in the DOOM games. 

A button menu at the top of the UI will allow users to select a demon, and display it's statistics; Name, Health Points, Attack Points, Special Attack name, and the origin of the demon.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
